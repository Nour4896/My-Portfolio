            <p class="bio">Thanks for stopping by! My name is Nour Harrak, I'm a front-end designer from Mississauga, Ontario, with additional experience in Graphic and UX Design. I'm currently studying at Humber College as I begin to build the foundation for my career in Computer Programming. Beyond my technical experience, I pride myself on my strong connective people skills gained through my years working in retail, as well as my adaptability and constant drive to learn.<br><br>Outside of work, I'm an avid fan of both sports and video games! For the former, I follow all major Pittsburgh teams (Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates), as well as the Toronto Raptors and Liverpool FC. For the latter, I keep up with a wide variety of genres, but some of my favourite video games of all time include Super Mario Galaxy, The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask, Bloodborne, Halo 2, and Persona 5! I also enjoy discovering new music, with some of my favourite genres being RnB, Indie, Midwest Emo, Rap, and Pop Punk.<br><br>I'd love the chance to get in touch with you and get an opportunity to work alongside you, whether in Front-End Development, UX Design, or Graphic Design. Please head over to my contact section and let's connect!</p>
